1. Import the required libraries:
   - numpy as np

2. Define the probability matrix P representing transitions between pages:
   - Each row represents the probabilities of transitioning from the current page to other pages.

3. Define the initial probability vectors for starting from Page 1 and Page 3:
   - x_start_page1 represents starting from Page 1.
   - x_start_page3 represents starting from Page 3.

4. Define a function simulate_movement to simulate the movement for a given number of steps:
   - This function takes the probability matrix P, the initial probability vector x, and the number of steps as input.
   - It iteratively multiplies the probability vector x by the probability matrix P for the specified number of steps using matrix multiplication.

5. Simulate movement starting from Page 1 for 100 steps:
   - Call the simulate_movement function with the probability matrix P, the initial probability vector x_start_page1, and 100 steps.
   - Print the composition of vector x after 100 steps starting from Page 1.

6. Simulate movement starting from Page 3 for 100 steps:
   - Call the simulate_movement function with the probability matrix P, the initial probability vector x_start_page3, and 100 steps.
   - Print the composition of vector x after 100 steps starting from Page 3.
